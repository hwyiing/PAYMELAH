# PayMELah Telegram Bot
Hack&Roll 2022 : Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
Being from the same social group, we often found it frustrating to keep track of how much each individual should pay after group meals. This compelled us to brainstorm of an efficient and accurate system that friend groups in Singapore could potentially use to automate this process of splitting bills. 

## What it does
Paymelah is  a user friendly telegram bot that facilitates the process of splitting bills within groups using OCR concept for its backend. All you have to do is upload an image of their receipt and with a click of a few buttons, the Paymelah bot will settle everything for you! 

## How we built it
We built Paymelah using telegrambot APIs for our bot flow, and our OCR with Pytesseract library 

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating different libraries into our system was challenging **add more stuff**

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for payMElah telebot
1)With more time, we could improve the accuracy of our OCR AI backend by training it on the dataset of labelled receipt images
2)Bot user experience can be enhanced by refining bot flow or adding extra features
3)Integration of payment systems into the bot flow so that users can reimburse their friends conveniently
