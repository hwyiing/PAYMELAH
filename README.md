# PayMELah Telegram Bot
Hack&Roll 2022 : Hackathon Project

## Inspiration
Have to work out some crazy math after eating out with your friends? With payMElah, you'll never have to stare at your receipt calculating! Simply send a photo of the receipt to our Telegram bot and let it do your work for you. It's that simple. Settle group payments in a blink of an eye with our Telegram bot, payMElah! 

Being from the same social group, we often found it frustrating to keep track of how much each individual should pay after group meals. We came across a TikTok video showing how the accountant in a social group had to perform seemingly insanely complicated calculations whenever he ate out with his friends. All those intimidating numbers and equations prodded us to think, "Is there a way to automate this?". This compelled us to brainstorm of an efficient and accurate system that friend groups in Singapore could potentially use to automate this process of splitting bills. 

## What it does
Paymelah is  a user friendly telegram bot that facilitates the process of splitting bills within groups using OCR concept for its backend. All you have to do is upload an image of their receipt and with a click of a few buttons, the Paymelah bot will settle everything for you! 

## How we built it
We built Paymelah using telegrambot APIs for our bot flow, and our OCR with Pytesseract library 

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating different libraries into our system was challenging **add more stuff**

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for payMElah telebot
1)With more time, we could improve the accuracy of our OCR AI backend by training it on the dataset of labelled receipt images
2)Bot user experience can be enhanced by refining bot flow or adding extra features
3)Integration of payment systems into the bot flow so that users can reimburse their friends conveniently
